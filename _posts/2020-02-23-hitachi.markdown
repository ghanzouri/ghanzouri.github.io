#### October 2019 – June 2020, Stanford, CA

## ***Work In Progress***

I am part of ME310: Engineering Design, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, a design methodology class at Stanford University.
I am working as a student collaborator in partnership with Tokyo Tech, Japan, on the [Hitachi America project](http://our310.stanford.edu/index.php/Projects/HomePage#Hitachi_America) to redesign a safe, enjoyable, and reliable food supply chain and procurement experience for elderly who live in typical asian cities.

We are currently working in the **prototype and user-testing phase.**

# 2. Critical Function Prototype 1:

In this prototype, we were tasked with identifying one critical function that could be prototyped and tested for validity.

# 3. Critical Function Prototype 2:

In this prototype, we expanded into identifying another  critical function that could be prototyped and tested for validity.
