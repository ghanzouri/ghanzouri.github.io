I worked for 6 months for a personal project at ThincLab, a start-up incubator.

I worked weekly with mentors on Skype or in my office at ThincLab. I learned the different process of ideation and design thinking.

The project involved product design, mechatronics, robotics, electronics and SQL database.

I have established a [Business Model Canvas]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/thinclab/BusinessModelCanvas.pdf), a market study on [SurveyMonkey][survey] that generated more than 400 responses and a storyboard.
