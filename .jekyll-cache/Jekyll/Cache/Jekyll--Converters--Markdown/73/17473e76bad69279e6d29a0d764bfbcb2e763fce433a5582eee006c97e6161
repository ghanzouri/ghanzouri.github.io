<p><strong>**Work In Progress</strong>**</p>

<p>I am part of ME310: Engineering Design, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, a design methodology class at Stanford University.
I am working as a student collaborator in partnership with Tokyo Tech, Japan, on the <a href="http://our310.stanford.edu/index.php/Projects/HomePage#Hitachi_America">Hitachi America project</a> to redesign a safe, enjoyable, and reliable food supply chain and procurement experience for elderly who live in typical asian cities..</p>

<p>We are currently working in the <strong>prototype and user-testing phase.</strong></p>
