<p>The Dassault UAV Challenge is an aerospace student competition dedicated to Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) domain. It was organized by Dassault Aviation. The challenge was based on the same hexacopter platform for each team (to be assembled with components provided by Dassault Aviation).</p>

<p>Each team had to design a home-made package delivery system and integrate it in the hexacopter. The main part of the development focused on the system integration, the real-time software development and flight tests. The challenge lasted 7 months to perform the whole development and a 2-days competition final in May with several tests and workshops had to be completed.</p>

<p>To perform the competition, each team had to design and integrate its own package delivery system in its hexacopter, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a storage system to carry and release three packages on demand</li>
  <li>associated embedded algorithms to deliver autonomously and precisely each package on pre-defined target points</li>
</ul>

<p>In our team, I was personally in charge in designing the package delivery system.</p>
