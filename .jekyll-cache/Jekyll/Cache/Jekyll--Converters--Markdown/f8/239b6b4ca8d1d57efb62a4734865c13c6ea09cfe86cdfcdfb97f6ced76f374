I"ó<p>I worked for 6 months for a personal project at ThincLab, a start-up incubator.</p>

<p>The project involved product design, mechatronics, robotics, electronics and SQL database.</p>

<p>I have established a <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/thinclab/BusinessModelCanvas.pdf">Business Model Canvas</a>, a market study on <a href="https://fr.surveymonkey.com/r/X93DGZV">SurveyMonkey</a> that generated more than 400 responses and a storyboard.</p>
