I"¹<p>At Arts et MÃ©tiers Paris, a French Mechanical and Industrial Engineer School, I conducted a research project where we had to industrial design a piezoelectric speaker.</p>

<p>First, we carried a benchmarking, an analysis of existing on the market. The 3D printing material was PLA. We then studied in-depth this material during lab sessions. These sessions allowed us to understand the behaviour of this material and thus predict its impact on our speaker structure. Finally, we were able to design the speaker on Catia and conduct simulations on Abaqus in order to study the constraints that will be applied.</p>
