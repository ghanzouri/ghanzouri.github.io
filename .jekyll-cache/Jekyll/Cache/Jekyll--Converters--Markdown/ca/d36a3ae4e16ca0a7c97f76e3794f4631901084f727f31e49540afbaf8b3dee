I"k<p>I worked for 6 months for a personal project at ThincLab, a start-up incubator.
The project involved product design, mechatronics, robotics, electronics and SQL database.
I have established a Business Model Canvas, a market study on <a href="https://fr.surveymonkey.com/r/X93DGZV">SurveyMonkey</a> that generated more than 400 responses and a storyboard.</p>
