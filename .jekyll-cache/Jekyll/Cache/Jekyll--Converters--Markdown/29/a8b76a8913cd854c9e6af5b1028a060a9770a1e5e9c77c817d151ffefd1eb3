<h4 id="september-2019--may-2019-paris--france">September 2019 – May 2019, Paris , France</h4>

<p>The Dassault UAV Challenge is an aerospace student competition dedicated to Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) domain. It was organized by Dassault Aviation. The challenge was based on the same hexacopter platform for each team (to be assembled with components provided by Dassault Aviation).</p>

<p>Each team had to design a home-made package delivery system and integrate it in the hexacopter. The main part of the development focused on the system integration, the real-time software development and flight tests. The challenge lasted 7 months to perform the whole development and a 2-days competition final in May with several tests and workshops had to be completed.</p>

<p>To perform the competition, each team had to design and integrate its own package delivery system in its hexacopter, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a storage system to carry and release three packages on demand</li>
  <li>associated embedded algorithms to deliver autonomously and precisely each package on pre-defined target points</li>
</ul>

<p>In our team, I was personally in charge in designing the package delivery system.</p>

<p>The system is composed in two parts.</p>

<p>The first one is a cylindrical compartment which will contain the 3 packages and 1 empty space. This cylinder rotates inside the external fixed cylinder by the means of a servomotor located at the base of the drone. This servo can rotate up to 270°.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this internal cylinder is guided in rotation by means of an external cylindrical base which is fixed to the drone. A cover attached to the outer cylinder is located at the base of the release system and has a door actioned by a servomotor.</p>

<p>When the camera detects a cross, the compartment (the inner cylinder) rotates and places the package corresponding to the colour of the cross above the door. Then the servomotor opens the door and drops the package on the cross.</p>

<h2 id="b-packages-description">b.	Packages description</h2>

<p>The packages are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rectangular prism: height 80mm, base 30x30mm</li>
  <li>3 colours: red, yellow, blue</li>
  <li>Free choice of material (but homogeneous)</li>
  <li>No weight constraint</li>
  <li>No parachute</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to meet these expectations, I used the following resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A MakerBot 3D printer available in the additive manufacturing room.</li>
  <li>Its associated 3D printing software MakerBot.</li>
  <li>A machining lathe for the production of the outer cylinder</li>
</ul>

<p>All parts of the dropping system were designed using Catia, which is the design software that we mainly used in Arts et Métiers ParisTech.</p>

<p>During the design, I realized the importance of fillets in certain location of our system (especially at position of high efforts for example at the interior cylinder), and I had to design several prototypes of the door authorizing or not the release of the package, because we did not want it too cumbersome, whereas the first impressions had given us non-viable parts.</p>

<p>For printing, I used the MakerBot software from the 3D printer. After multiple iteration of different prototypes, I found the best optimal printing parameters. I chose a print fill rate of 15%: giving a good compromise between lightness and correct mechanical properties and a correct print resolution (compromise between print time and print quality).</p>
