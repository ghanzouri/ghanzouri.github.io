about-author: Hello, my name is Ilies Ghanzouri and I am passionate in product design. All my life, I craved to be working on innovative projects. My motto in life has always been about innovating and creating objects to help and ease our everyday life. I always had innovative ideas in mind and wanted to bring my concepts to life. To stimulate my passion for design, I undertook projects in mechatronics in undergrad at Arts et MÃ©tiers ParisTech, a French Mechanical Engineer school. Currently, I am pursuing a MS in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University with a concentration in Design Methodology and a Minor in Computer Science (CS161, CS230, CS229). Due to my high interest in computer science and mechatronics, I believe the Stanford Design group (ME310) will foster my grasp of the incorporation of mechatronics and machine learning algorithms into innovative solutions.
